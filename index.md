Computer Science PhD Student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, interested in computer vision, robotics, machine learning, computer graphics. I work with Prof. [Michael Gleicher](https://gleicher.sites.cs.wisc.edu/) and Prof. [Mohit Gupta](https://wisionlab.cs.wisc.edu/people/mohit-gupta/). 

Most recently, we published a paper in RA-L titled Geometric Calibration of Single-Pixel Distance Sensors, in which we describe and evaluate a procedure for calibrating the pose of a distance sensor attached to a robot arm.
